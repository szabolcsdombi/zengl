ZenGL
-----

ZenGL is a minimalist Python module providing exactly **one** way to render scenes with OpenGL.

.. code::

    pip install zengl

- `Documentation <https://zengl.readthedocs.io/>`_
- `zengl on Github <https://github.com/szabolcsdombi/zengl/>`_
- `zengl on PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/zengl/>`_

**ZenGL is ...**

- **high-performance**
- **simple** - *buffers, images, pipelines and there you go*
- **easy-to-learn** - *it is simply OpenGL with no magic added*
- **verbose** - *most common mistakes are catched and reported in a clear and understandable way*
- **robust** - *there is no global state or external trouble-maker affecting the render*
- **backward-compatible** - *it requires OpenGL 3.3 - it is just enough*
- **cached** - *most OpenGL objects are reused between renders*
- **zen** - *there is one way to do it*

.. py:class:: Context

| Represents an OpenGL context.

.. py:class:: Buffer

| Represents an OpenGL buffer.

.. py:class:: Image

| Represents an OpenGL texture or renderbuffer.

.. py:class:: Pipeline

| Represents an entire rendering pipeline including the global state, shader program, framebuffer, vertex state,
  uniform buffer bindings, samplers, and sampler bindings.

Concept
-------

| ZenGL provides a simple way to render from Python. We aim to support headless rendering first,
  rendering to a window is done by blitting the final image to the screen. By doing this we have full control of
  what we render. The window does not have to be multisample, and it requires no depth buffer at all.

| Offscreen rendering works out of the box on all platforms if the right loader is provided.
| Loaders implement a load method to resolve a subset of OpenGL 3.3 core. The return value of the load method is
  an int, a void pointer to the function implementation.
| Virtualized, traced, and debug environments can be provided by custom loaders.
| The current implementation uses the glcontext from moderngl to load the OpenGL methods.

| ZenGL's main focus is on readability and maintainability. Pipelines in ZenGL are almost entirely immutable and they
  cannot affect each other except when one draws on top of the other's result that is expected.
  No global state is affecting the render, if something breaks there is one place to debug.

| ZenGL does not use anything beyond OpenGL 3.3 core, not even if the more convenient methods are available.
  Implementation is kept simple. Usually, this is not a bottleneck.

| ZenGL does not implement transform feedback, storage buffers or storage images, tesselation, geometry shader, and maybe many more.
  We have a strong reason not to include them in the feature list. They add to the complexity and are against ZenGL's main philosophy.
  ZenGL was built on top experience gathered on real-life projects that could never make good use of any of that.

| ZenGL is using the same vertex and image format naming as WebGPU and keeping the vertex array definition from ModernGL.
  ZenGL is not the next version of ModernGL. ZenGL is a simplification of a subset of ModernGL with some extras
  that was not possible to include in ModernGL.

Context
-------

.. py:method:: zengl.context(loader: ContextLoader) -> Context

All interactions with OpenGL are done by a Context object.
There should be a single Context created per application.
A Context is created with the help of a context loader.
A context loader is an object implementing the load method to resolve OpenGL functions by name.
This enables zengl to be entirely platform-independent.

.. py:method:: zengl.loader(headless: bool = False) -> ContextLoader

This method provides a default context loader. It requires `glcontext` to be installed.
ZenGL does not implement OpenGL function loading. glcontext is used when no alternatives are provided.

.. note::

    Implementing a context loader enables zengl to run in custom environments.
    ZenGL uses a subset of the OpenGL 3.3 core, the list of methods can be found in the project source.

**Context for a window**

.. code-block::

    ctx = zengl.context()

**Context for headless rendering**

.. code-block::

    ctx = zengl.context(zengl.loader(headless=True))

Buffer
------

| Buffers hold vertex, index, and uniform data used by rendering.
| Buffers are not variable-sized, they are allocated upfront in the device memory.

.. code-block::

    vertex_buffer = ctx.buffer(np.array([0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0], 'f4'))

.. code-block::

    index_buffer = ctx.buffer(np.array([0, 1, 2], 'i4'))

.. code-block::

    vertex_buffer = ctx.buffer(size=1024)

.. py:method:: Context.buffer(data, size, dynamic, external) -> Buffer

**data**
    | The buffer content, represented as ``bytes`` or a buffer for example a numpy array.
    | If the data is None the content of the buffer will be uninitialized and the size is mandatory.
    | The default value is None.

**size**
    | The size of the buffer. It must be None if the data parameter was provided.
    | The default value is None and it means the size of the data.

    | An int, representing the size of the buffer in bytes to be mapped.
    | The default value is None and it means the entire buffer.

**offset**
    | An int, representing the offset in bytes for the mapping.
    | When the offset is not None the size must also be defined.
    | The default value is None and it means the beginning of the buffer.

**discard**
    | A boolean to enable the ``GL_MAP_INVALIDATE_RANGE_BIT``
    | When this flag is True, the content of the buffer is undefined.
    | The default value is False.

.. py:method:: Buffer.unmap()

    Unmap the buffer.

.. py:attribute:: Buffer.size

    An int, representing the size of the buffer in bytes.

Image
-----

| Images hold texture data or render outputs.
| Images with texture support are implemented with OpenGL textures.
| Render outputs that are not sampled from the shaders are using renderbuffers instead.

**render targets**

Shader Code
-----------

- **do** use ``#version 450 core`` as the first line in the shader.
- **do** use ``layout (std140, binding = ...)`` for uniform buffers.
- **do** use ``layout (location = ...)`` for the vertex shader inputs.
- **do** use ``layout (location = ...)`` for the fragment shader outputs.

- **don't** use ``layout (location = ...)`` for the vertex shader outputs or the fragment shader inputs.
  Matching name and order are sufficient and much more readable.

- **don't** use ``layout (binding = ...)`` for the uniform buffers or samplers.
  It is not a core feature in OpenGL 3.3 and ZenGL enforces the program layout from the pipeline parameters.

- **do** use uniform buffers, use a single one if possible.
- **don't** use uniforms, use uniform buffers instead.
- **don't** put constants in uniform buffers, use ``#include`` and string formatting.
- **don't** over-use the ``#include`` statement.
- **do** use includes without extensions.

- **do** arrange pipelines in such an order to minimize framebuffer then program changes.

Shader Includes
---------------

| Shader includes were designed to solve a single problem of sharing code among shaders without having to field format the shader code.
| Includes are simple string replacements from :py:attr:`Context.includes`
| The include statement stands for including constants, functions, logic or behavior, but not files. Hence the naming should not contain extensions like ``.h``
| Nested includes do not work, they are overcomplicated and could cause other sorts of issues.

.. py:attribute:: Context.includes

    | A string to string mapping dict.

**Example**

.. code-block::

    ctx.includes['common'] = '...'

    pipeline = ctx.pipeline(
        vertex_shader='''
            #version 450 core

            #include "common"
            #include "qtransform"

            void main() {
            }
        ''',
    )

Include Patterns
----------------

**common uniform buffer**

.. code-block::

    ctx.includes['common'] = '''
        layout (std140, binding = 0) uniform Common {
            mat4 mvp;
        };
    '''

**quaternion transform**

.. code-block::

    ctx.includes['qtransform'] = '''
        vec3 qtransform(vec4 q, vec3 v) {
            return v + 2.0 * cross(cross(v, q.xyz) - q.w * v, q.xyz);
        }
    '''

**gaussian filter**

.. code-block::

    def kernel(s):
        x = np.arange(-s, s + 1)
        y = np.exp(-x * x / (s * s / 4))
        y /= y.sum()
        v = ', '.join(f'{t:.8f}' for t in y)
        return f'const int N = {s * 2 + 1};\nfloat coeff[N] = float[]({v});'

    ctx.includes['kernel'] = kernel(19)

**hsv to rgb**

.. code-block::

    ctx.includes['hsv2rgb'] = '''
        vec3 hsv2rgb(vec3 c) {
            vec4 K = vec4(1.0, 2.0 / 3.0, 1.0 / 3.0, 3.0);
            vec3 p = abs(fract(c.xxx + K.xyz) * 6.0 - K.www);
            return c.z * mix(K.xxx, clamp(p - K.xxx, 0.0, 1.0), c.y);
        }
    '''

Rendering to Texture
--------------------

Rendering to texture is supported. However, multisampled images must be downsampled before being used as textures.
In that case, an intermediate render target must be samples > 1 and texture = False.
Then this image can be downsampled with :py:meth:`Image.blit` to another image with samples = 1 and texture = True.

Cleanup
-------

Clean only if necessary. It is ok not to clean up before the program ends.

.. py:method:: Context.release(obj: Buffer | Image | Pipeline | str)

This method releases the OpenGL resources associated with the parameter.
OpenGL resources are not released automatically on garbage collection.
Release Pipelines before the Images and Buffers they use.

When the string ``shader_cache`` is passed to this method,
it calls glDeleteShader for all the previously created vertex and fragment shader modules.

When the string ``all`` is passed to this method, it releases all the resources allocated from this context.

Interoperability
----------------

| Some window implementations expose a framebuffer object for drawing.
| Detecting this framebuffer is an error-prone and non-reliable solution.
| The recommended way is to change :py:attr:`Context.screen` to the frambuffer object.
| Do not change the :py:attr:`Pipeline._framebuffer`. It is for a different purpose.

| Running zengl alongside another renderer is not supported.
| However, to port existing code to zengl, some interoperability may be necessary.
| OpenGL objects can be extracted with :py:meth:`zengl.inspect`.
| It is possible to interact with these objects using the OpenGL API directly.

.. py:method:: zengl.inspect(obj: Buffer | Image | Pipeline)

Returns an object with all of the OpenGL objects.

.. py:attribute:: Context.screen

| An integer representing the default framebuffer object.
| You may want to change this attribute when using PyQt.

.. py:attribute:: Pipeline._framebuffer

| An integer value of the framebuffer object used by the pipeline.
| This attribute can be changed.

.. py:method:: Context.reset()

| Reset assumptions on the current global OpenGL state. Assume a dirty OpenGL context.

Utils
-----

.. py:attribute:: Context.info

| The GL_VENDOR, GL_RENDERER, and GL_VERSION strings as a tuple.

.. py:attribute:: Context.limits

- max_uniform_buffer_bindings
- max_uniform_block_size
- max_combined_uniform_blocks
- max_combined_texture_image_units
- max_vertex_attribs
- max_draw_buffers
- max_samples

.. py:method:: zengl.camera(eye, target, up, fov, aspect, near, far, size, clip) -> bytes

| Returns a Model-View-Projection matrix for uniform buffers.
| The return value is bytes and can be used as a parameter for :py:meth:`Buffer.write`.

.. code-block::

    mvp = zengl.camera(eye=(4.0, 3.0, 2.0), target=(0.0, 0.0, 0.0), aspect=16.0 / 9.0, fov=45.0)

.. py:method:: zengl.bind(buffer: Buffer, layout: str, *attributes: Iterable[int]) -> List[VertexBufferBinding]

| Helper function for binding a single buffer to multiple vertex attributes.
| The -1 is a special value allowed in the attributes to represent not yet implemented attributes.
| An ending ``/i`` is allowed in the layout to represent per instance stepping.

.. py:method:: zengl.calcsize(layout: str) -> int

| Calculates the size of a vertex attribute buffer layout.
